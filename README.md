# Provisor
A project based on a client-server application to help trade on the platform Pancakeswap

Functionality of the client part of the application:
1. Adding coins for tracking.
2. Ability to track many coins at the same time.
3. Notifying the user when the price changes by more than the amount set by the user

The functionality of the server part of the application consists mainly in scanning the market and searching for the most volatile coins,
with the subsequent provision of this information to the client part
